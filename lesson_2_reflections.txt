What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates a .git folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is like a commit preparation area. Working directory is the directory on which you are developing the code or creating files initially on your computer. repository is the place on git where the files are commited to for collaborating. staging area prepares only the file needs to be commited to the repo and not all the files on the working area.
