how did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It was a bit difficult to find yourself the typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
This helps me check all the changes made to the file and we can revert back to any of the older versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manually choosing to create commit is useful as the info edited can be manualluy complete.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because those files are interrelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows the history of commits where git diff shows the difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
version control gives the option to revert to any other version even if the present commits breaks.
